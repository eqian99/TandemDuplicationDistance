    "\n",
    "One useful thing to do with a string is to get the nth character of a string\n",
    "for example if we wanted to figure out what is the 5th letter of hello\n",
    "we could try to access the 5th letter of hello, and it would return o.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below we assign 'hello' to the variable s.\n",
    "then we access the 5th character and assign the 5th character to the variable char. \n",
    "Note that strings are indexed at 0, this means the first character of a string 'hello' is given by s[0].\n",
