<h1> Ist4 programming challenge </h1>
    
<p> The first coding challenge is to implement a function that retrieves the minimum number of steps it takes to generate a string using only tandem duplications from one of the following starts strings [0, 1, 01, 10, 101, 010]  as listed in problem 1a on homework one. Once you have completed this you will realize that for large strings it takes a lot of time for your program to grow as the search space becomes much larger. The challenge is to think of ways to optimize this generation process and argue why your solution is good. Please in your solution describe your algorithm and approach. Discuss pros and cons and what things you like/dislike about your algorithm. Your code must be written in Python 3. The reason for writing code in python 3 is because this challenge is more about the algorithm then the implementation, while you could certainly make language level optimizations, we hope most of your time is allocated to thinking of better algorithms. </p>
    
<h2> logistics </h2>

<ul>
    <li>Due Thursday May 24 at 2:30p.m.</li>
    <li>Can work in groups of 2-3 </li>
    <li>Email your code and write up to istta4@paradise.caltech.edu </li>
</ul>
<h2>Helper code </h2>

<p>we have provided three files for you. fast_intro_to_python.ipynb is an ineractive way to learn python.
We have provided helpers.py which contains useful helper functions that you may want to use later. You can use the functions in helpers.py by running "from helpers import *" provided that helpers.py is in the same directory as your code. We have also provided intro_solver.ipynb which gives you an intuition on how to run your code</p>

<h2> Getting Setup</h2>

<p>setting up your coding environment can be really tricky. I will list out instructions, but if you are having trouble getting started you can reach me via email chaack@caltech.edu.</p>
<ol>
    <li> Install anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and select the python 3.6 version). Anaconda has many useful features, and allows you to access jupyter notebooks (denoted as ipynb files). which I use in the tutorial.</li>
    <li> once set up you can use the anaconda navigator to open jupyter or command prompt/terminal with command: jupyter notebook</li>
    <li> In jupyter you can go through the fast_intro_to_python if you have never seen it before or meet with chris, The intro is not complete and still has a bit of missing sections but it is enough to get you started.
